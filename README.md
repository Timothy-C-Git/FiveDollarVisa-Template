# FiveDollarVisa-Template
This is the most recent, open-source version of my FiveDollarVisa project/business. This includes everything from bot creation via Telegram API to button responses, with only web-interfacing gutted.


"Testing" folder contains the main functions of FiveDollarVisa-Template. fdv.java interfaces with Telegram Bot API and has commented notes on Selenium Webdriver example usage. Bot.java has functions for Bot responses, template of buttons for every country, And example Username and Bot Key to be replaced on lines 12 and 39.
